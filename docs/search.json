    "text": "About Me:\nI am an enthusiastic person, always curious and eager to learn new things. Love People. Love Travelling. Happy and Fun to be with. I always believe that technology plays a vital role in improving human life. I wanted to be a part and contribute to that technology journey. I have always been fascinated by a computer on Dadâ€™s desk since childhood and stories of him telling how much changes technology brought in his work. When I had to choose the path ahead, I have hence chosen Computer Science during my under graduation and Data Analytics Engineering during my graduation due to the rapid evolving nature of the data in the world."
